House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression Algorithm

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices using the linear regression algorithm. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes.

The linear regression algorithm is a popular choice for price prediction tasks due to its simplicity and interpretability. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (house price). By fitting a line to the data points, the model can make predictions on unseen instances based on their feature values.

The project involves several steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature scaling may also be applied to normalize the data and improve model performance.

2. Feature selection: Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable. This helps to eliminate unnecessary variables and improve model efficiency.

3. Model training: The linear regression model is trained using preprocessed data. The algorithm learns the coefficients for each feature, which determine the weight and direction of their impact on the predicted house prices.

4. Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics measure the model's accuracy by comparing its predictions with the actual house prices in the test set.

5. Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict house prices for new instances. By inputting the relevant features, the model calculates the estimated price based on the learned coefficients.
